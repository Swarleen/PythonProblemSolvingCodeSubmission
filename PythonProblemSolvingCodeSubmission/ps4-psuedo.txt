Your algorithms should be plain English explanations for the steps your program will take to solve these problems.

Write out your algorithm for Problem 2 here:
Aim: To decode the encrypted text.

1. We start by making a list from the given text file.
2. Settting the number of words as zero.
3. Initialise the best shift with zero, where shift will stay between 0 and 27.
	And call out the function apply_shift for the message.
4. Using " .split " to split the text into individual words.
5. We have to count the number of valid words in the wordlist and, (here we will use if-else statement)
	if the valid words are more than the total number of real words then,
		keep the no. of valid words 
6. Set the best shift to the recent shift.
7. Increment the recent shift by 1.
8. Return the best shift.

Write out your algorithm for Problem 4 here:
Aim: Using multi layer shift 

1. The first shift is for the first word of the text.
2. the second shoft starts from the second word.
3. Here shifts are layered, which means:
	the second shift will work from where the first shoft ends, i.e. the first word.
	and if we talk about the thir shift it will work from where the seconf sift ends.
4. apply reverse and we can subtract 3
